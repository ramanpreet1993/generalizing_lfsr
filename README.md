# generalizing_lfsr
The developed code (namely, generalizing_lfsr.cpp) works for an arbitrary length of the LFSR. It asks for input as the length, the feedback polynomial &amp; initial state of the LFSR from the user. It then describes the LFSR states upto a stage when the initial state given by the user is re-obtained &amp; thus gives the period of the LFSR.
